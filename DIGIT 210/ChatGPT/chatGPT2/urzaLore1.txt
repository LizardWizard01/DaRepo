Prompt: Tell me the story of Urza

Urza is a fictional character from the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. He is one of the most famous and powerful planeswalkers, known for his cunning, his vast knowledge of magic, and his role in the story of the game.

Urza was born in the ancient city of Terisiare on the plane of Dominaria. He was the younger brother of Mishra, and the two of them were apprentices to the great artificer Tocasia. However, their relationship became strained as they competed for Tocasia's attention and the right to inherit her workshop. This competition eventually led to a conflict between the two brothers that would last for centuries.

Urza eventually discovered that he was a planeswalker, a rare being with the ability to travel between the different planes of the multiverse. He used his powers to explore the many different worlds and gather knowledge and artifacts that would help him in his battle against Mishra.

Urza's quest for power and knowledge led him to create the Thran Mana Rig, a powerful artifact that would help him control the flow of mana on Dominaria. However, the Thran Mana Rig attracted the attention of the evil Phyrexians, who sought to conquer Dominaria. Urza eventually realized that the only way to stop the Phyrexians was to destroy the Thran Mana Rig, but in doing so, he caused a massive explosion that wiped out the Thran civilization and left a huge crater known as the Scar of the Spheres.
