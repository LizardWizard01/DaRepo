I manually added an <xml> tag around the text

I found and replaced all & with:
Find: &
Replace: &amp;

Then I tagged each movie line with <movie> using:
Find: ^.+
Replace: <movie>\0</movie>

Then I tagged all the titles using:
Find: (<movie>)(.+?)\t
Replace: \1<title>\2</title>

Lastly I manually put a xml tag over everything
