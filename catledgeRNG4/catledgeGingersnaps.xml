    <title>Gingersnaps</title>

    <desc>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home dunked in
        tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday season.
        But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a
        comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</desc>

            <coatingIng>Coating 
                <ing ref="gsugar">1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</ing>

        <instructions>Instructions 
            <step n="1">Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line
                with parchment) two baking sheets.</step>
            <step n="2">Beat together the <in ref="shortening gsugar salt bakingsoda">shortening,
                    sugar, salt, and baking soda.</in></step>
            <step n="3">Beat in the <in ref="egg molasses">egg, then the molasses.</in></step>
            <step n="4">Add the <in ref="apFlour ginger cloves cinnamon">flour and spices</in>,
                beating to make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>
            <step n="5">To make the coating, combine the <in ref="gsugar cinnamon">sugar and
                    cinnamon</in>, and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>
            <step n="6">Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon
                cookie scoop is perfect here.</step>
            <step n="7">Roll the balls in the <in ref="gsugar">sugar</in> to coat, then transfer
                them to the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll
                spread as they bake.</step>
            <step n="8">Bake the cookies for 11 minutes, for cookies that are crisp around the
                edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for 13 minutes, for cookies that are
                crisp/crunchy all the way through.</step>
            <step n="9">Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a rack.
                Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room
            temperature.</step>
